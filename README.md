# Description

This app allows you to integrate an iframe in your Cozy to your application
cluster while managing an authentication with CAS (Central Authentication
Service). It's a single sign-in: You only have to enter your credentials once,
and you'll be logged in forever (as long as don't click the "Disconnect" button
within the app).

It has been specifically designed to work with the ENT (Espace Num√©rique de
Travail, which would translate in Virtual Workspace) of the engineering school
ISEN Brest, but can be reused in order to work with almost any application
cluster using a CAS server. You'll just have a couple of variables to redefine,
and a few more lines to rewrite in order to add your own services (CAS clients).

The app is entirely in French up to now, but we plan on translating it in the
future.

# What is Cozy?

[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you
with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one
profiles you. You install only the applications you want. You can build your
own one too.
